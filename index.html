    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
      I am eagerly seeking my entry into a lifelong career of web application and software development.
      My motivation grows with each project and class that I complete. While working for the NSA,
      I was enthralled by the vast impact of our web applications and specialized software.

    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <p>
      I utilize the skills I have learned throughout my college experience and the Microsoft Software Systems Academy
      to create personalized web applications. I have created several small web applications as well as a Discord bot
      to announce the arrival and departure of users from voice channels. I enjoy reading about new frameworks
      (such as the new .NET MAUI) in my free time, and coding through problems is always a great stress relief.
